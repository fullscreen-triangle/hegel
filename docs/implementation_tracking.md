## Technical Decisions

This section documents important technical decisions made during development.

### Computational Framework Selection
- Decision: Using RDKit for molecular operations and visualization data preparation
- Rationale: Industry standard open-source cheminformatics library with Python bindings

### Database Technology 
- Decision: Neo4j graph database
- Rationale: Graph database is ideal for modeling molecular relationships and similarity networks

### Visualization Technology
- Decision: Three.js for 3D molecule visualization and D3.js for network graphs
- Rationale: Three.js provides excellent 3D capabilities for molecule rendering, while D3.js is optimized for interactive network graphs

### Frontend Framework
- Decision: React with Tailwind CSS for styling
- Rationale: Modern, component-based architecture with utility-first CSS framework for rapid development
